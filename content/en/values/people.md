### 1. We value common success on the same level with personal.

* We are open to colleagues, we share personal and team experience.

#### Practices & rituals: 
{{< glossary title="Communities" >}}
Our company is divided into products and domains.
It means that we do not separate IT teams and business teams.
These conditions make professional communities and guilds vital.

is a source of organizational and professional help and
almost the only way to keep a connection between colleagues with similar competences across the organization.
It is highly encouraged for teams to invest resources in community development.

and quickly try something else, a concept known as pivoting.
