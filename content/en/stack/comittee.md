# What is technology committee

The committee is a community of enterprise architects, technical architects, and technical leaders of development teams and IT infrastructure. The main goal of the committee is to select and recommend the use of technologies in the Leroy Merlin Russia and to improve the efficiency of using the company's resources. Technologies mean programming languages, frameworks and libraries, software tools, and approaches in the context of specific use cases.

# The purpose of the committee
The main flow of committee discussions revolves around the selection of technologies that are recommended as the best choice for a particular use case. Technologies are divided into sections: *research*, *trial use*, *best choice* and *hold*. The position of technologies in these sections is a strong recommendation for selection when creating new software components. Questions can be posed by committee members or come from outside as requests from product teams. An important role of the committee is to discuss technologies for adoption in the *research* section. After discussing the results, the technology can be recommended for usage.
