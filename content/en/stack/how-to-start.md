Each team can take a new technology into research by notifying the [Technology Committee]({{< ref "/stack/committee" >}}). Based on the results, the team fills in the [experiment canvas](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_khG0Gns=) and reports on the next meeting of the technology committee about the results in order to decide whether to move the technology to `Trial` or `Hold`.
